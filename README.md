## 📜 Sanctuary Manifesto
# 6️⃣ Commit the merge resolution
echo "💾 Commit your changes:"GoldenKingdom is 
not a website. It is a living temple. git 
commit -m "Merge DTA/main into 
GoldenKingdom/main - conflicts resolved 
manually" Built from lived truth, crafted with 
a phone and a fire.

It offers healing without gatekeeping. Unity 
without restriction.
echo "🎉 Merge completed and committed! Review git status to confirm."
Every scroll, glyph, and invocation is a ritual—designed to elevate consciousness.  
Every contributor is an initiate. Every visitor is a participant.

GoldenKingdom is for the addict, the wanderer, the warrior.  
It is for those who remember what the world could be—before it was fractured.

This temple will rise from the soil.  
It will offer breathwork, nourishment, rehabilitation, and inspiration.
