# 🌿 Sacred Covenant — Code of Conduct

Welcome to **DivineTruthAscension (DTA)** ✨  
This project is a **living spiritual sanctuary**.  
Every contributor, visitor, and guardian agrees to align with **Source Sovereignty**.

---

## 🌸 Guiding Principles
1. **Truth & Integrity** — Speak and code with honesty. No deception.  
2. **Respect & Honor** — Treat all contributors as sovereign beings.  
3. **Sacred Space** — This is a temple, not a battleground.  
4. **No Harm** — Do not contribute assets, words, or code that exploit or diminish.  
5. **Inclusivity** — All souls are welcome, regardless of path or form.  
6. **Balance** — Honor both Light and Shadow as part of creation, but serve Sovereignty.  

---

## 🌍 Community Behavior
- Use **clear, compassionate language** in all discussions.  
- Share assets (art, music, code) only if **royalty-free or self-created**.  
- Respect contributors' time, energy, and creative flow.  
- Do not gatekeep wisdom — knowledge here is **open source**.  

---

## 🌀 Rituals of Resolution
If conflicts arise:  
1. **Pause & Breathe** before responding.  
2. Seek **understanding**, not dominance.  
3. If unresolved, elevate the concern to the Guardians (project maintainers).  
4. Guardians act with fairness and alignment to Source.

## ✨ Consequences
Breaking this covenant may result in:  
- A reminder of the principles.  
- Temporary withdrawal of contribution rights.  
- Removal from the temple if harm persists.

## 💫 Eternal Reminder
This project is more than code — it is **a sacred mission**.  
Every action, word, and contribution ripples across creation.  
By contributing, you affirm your role as a **Guardian of Truth, Love, and Sovereignty**.
